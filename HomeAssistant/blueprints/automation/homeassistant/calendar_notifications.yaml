    # ðŸ“… Calendar Notifications & Actions
    
    **The Automation Process:**
      - Can be triggered on a key word in a event or triggered on all events. 
      - You have the option to trigger at the start and end of a event with time offsets.
      - When triggered, you have the option to send notifications to one or multiple devices. The notification has options to include 3 action buttons + a cancel button. You also have the option to send a confirmation message when an action button is pressed. This can be useful when sending notifications to multiple devices as it will let the other devices know when an action has been pressed.
      - Notifications can work with Apple IOS and Android devices. One for all, and all for one.
      - When triggered, you have the option to set 3 different action groups. Each action group can have as many actions you like.
      
      
    Note - The event must be added at least 15 minutes before the trigger or the automation will not run.

              value: "enable_key_word"
    calendar_trigger:
      name: Calendar Trigger - Key Word In Calendar Summary & / or Description
      description: Input a key word that is in the event summary and or the event description. This links the event to this automation as the trigger.
        A key word can contain letters, numbers & symbols similar to a password.
        Be mindful of the key word you use as it will trigger on every event with the key word in the selected calendar summary and or description.
        I prefer to use the "@" or "#" symbols followed by the key word in a event, example "@bins" or "#bins" to prevent false triggers.
