    # ♾️ Sensor Light Add On - Media & Movie - House Alarm - Smoke Alarm + More
    
    **Version: 1.6**
    
    
    Below are some use cases.
    
      - Media - Cinema Room - Turn ON different lights when watching a movie.
      - House Alarm - Turn ON lights when your house alarm has been activated.
      - Smoke Detector - Turn on lights and exhaust fans when smoke detector has been activated.

    **The Automation Process:**
      - The example below will be for a movie night or use in a cinema room. It can also be used to turn on lights when your house alarm has been activated or turn on lights and exhaust fans when a smoke detector has been activated. For more examples and information check out "The Settings & Best Practice Guidelines:" [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/591824/3?u=blacky)
      - When a movie is being played (Started), the lights, switches and or scenes are turned ON to a movie mode set by you.
      - You have the option to turn OFF selected lights and or switches at the start of movie.
      - You have the option to use "Intermission", so when a movie is paused it can turn ON different slightly brighter lights to keep you in the movie mode.
      - When a movie is stopped, the lights, switches and or scenes are turned OFF.
      - You have the option to turn ON selected lights, switches and or scenes at the end of a movie.
      - You have the option to use the "Automation Link Option". This disables other automations via a By-pass control option when a movie is activated. It is designed to work with my other blueprints.
      - You have the option to use the "Sun Elevation". This is used for adding a condition to only work when it is dark by setting the suns position to the horizon.
      - You have the option to set an Ambient Light Sensor and set the LUX value. This is used for adding a condition to only work when it is dark or below the Ambient Light LUX Value.
      - You have the option to use the "By-pass". This allows you to add a by-pass switch to manually By-pass the automation.
    
    **Automation Link Option:** The automation link option works best when used with my other blueprints like 💡 [Sensor Light](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/481048), 🚿 [Bathroom Humidity Exhaust Fan](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/509992) + other blueprints of mine so, be sure to check them out.
